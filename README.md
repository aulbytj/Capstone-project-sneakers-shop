# Capstone-project-sneakers-shop


> In this project, I created Amaris Azario Collection a clothing store webpage similar to the layout or that of the sneaker shop all pages are responsive and have a few animated transitional effects.

For this project, I use HTML and CSS, Flexbox and CSS grid systems to build the page, construct the layout and to style the page.

features that I'm proud of is the navbar that I made with pure CSS and HTML
